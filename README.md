# Classification-Algorithms-Comparison-Framingham-Heart-Study

## A Brief Explanation
The aim of this project is to study the database called Framingham Heart Study on people who have suffered a coronary heart disease or not in the last ten years and to develop a predictive model that allows us, with a good degree of generalization, to identify and predict which patients are most likely to have coronary problems.
